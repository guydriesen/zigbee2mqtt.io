## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `learn_ir_code` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"learn_ir_code": "ON"}`, `{"learn_ir_code": "OFF"}` or `{"learn_ir_code": "undefined"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Learned ir code (text)
The IR code learned by device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `learned_ir_code` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Ir code to send (text)
The IR code to send by device.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"ir_code_to_send": NEW_VALUE}`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Voltage of the battery in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mV`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
